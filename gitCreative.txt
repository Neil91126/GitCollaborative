Today Aristotle plotted an evil scheme
A machination of sorts against all those whove wronged him
Standing against him was the shining hero Neil
Aristotle holding a spear the size of a tree and Neil with a dagger the size of a dagger
Their duel will go down in the history books as the coolest most epic duel ever
Aristotles spear came crashing down upon neil in a hurricane of blows
The nimble Neil evading every attack easily
But all of a sudden Aristotle pulled out a glaive from seemingly no where and swung horizontally towards Neils torso
Neil instantly leapt into the air, landing upon Aristotle with a fury of blows that caused critical damage
